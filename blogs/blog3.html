<p><img alt="import-export" src="https://github.com/tanishq-h/repo/blob/b2/images/blog3/import-export.jpg?raw=true" /></p>
<p>As of 2023, America is the world's largest exporting nation of energy. It is exporting about 8.6 million barrels of oil and 12.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. That is an exceptional feat that marks a huge turn around in the U.S. energy landscape. More than a decade ago, it was, in all essential senses, still a net importer, meeting its energy needs by importing from other countries.</p>
<p>The shift really got underway around 2010, driven by even more sophisticated extraction techniques in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. That released enormous reservoirs of oil and gas, but particularly in the shale formations, so that the United States could easily increase its own domestic supply. The first quarter of 2020 marked the first instance since 67 years wherein the U.S. exported more energy than the one it imported, and it presented the lowest gross energy imports since 1995.</p>
<p>This shift is technological progress and a strategic turn regarding energy policy to decrease the dependence on international sources of energy. It hasn't been an easy road for the U.S. to evolve from a traditional importer into an exporter. As it now becomes a global energy player, the U.S. faces the toughest international relations, particularly with its top trading partners. For instance, the level of U.S. natural gas exports has dramatically dropped in China partly for geopolitical reasons.</p>
<p>As the United States moves forward in this new role, many questions remain open to speculation about how best the country can use its newfound energy surplus with open arms to global partnerships in an increasingly interconnected world. Only time will tell how American energy exports play out with these forces coming together.</p>

<h2 id="rising-crude-oil-exports"><strong>Rising Crude Oil Exports</strong></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most dramatic change in the U.S. energy sector has been the sudden surge in crude oil exports. For decades, the United States had been a net importer of crude oil, but the status quo went through dramatic changes between 2018 and 2019 as net oil trade fell by 31 percent—fourheads, or about 1.9 million bpd.</p>
<p>This trend emerged mainly due to extraordinary increases in domestic crude oil production. In fact, the EIA states that the U.S. Government monitors the energy-related activities, and oil production was at 5.4 million bpd in 2010 but had surged to 12.2 million bpd in 2019. Such growth resulted in reduced dependence on imports for the country, thus enabling the United States to regain its position in the international oil market.</p>
<p>One significant factor was the lifting of the nearly four-decade-long prohibition on U.S. crude oil exports, which began in 1977. The Obama administration ended it in 2015. The dramatic change unleashed an export boom: U.S. average annual crude oil exports were 128 million barrels throughout all of 2014 but by 2019 had ballooned almost tenfold to more than one billion barrels.</p>
<p>Consequently, the U.S. has shed off reliance on imported crude oil as it becomes a competitive player in the global oil market with changes in role and influence within energy trade.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="strong-petroleum-export"><strong>Strong Petroleum Export</strong></h2>
<p>America has seen a large percentage of crude oil-based products of petroleum manufacturing. It had to play the most pivotal role in trying to equate its energy sector's input with the USA. The increased amount of production and imports as well as exports have seen major surges. Huge percentages of these have indeed made such a major chase for countries like India and the United Kingdom. The total annual exports of petroleum from the United States to India from 2014 to 2019 increased from 25.5 million to a total of 170.9 million barrels, whereas exports to the UK increased to 122.4 million barrels over the same period.</p>
<p>This production gain can be linked to more efficiency in the U.S. petroleum industry. According to Deloitte's 2020 oil and gas outlook, investors care more about efficiency even if the industry declines. The report highlighted that in 2019, the U.S. oil industry "has shown great volume growth, moderate capital spends, weak operating cash flows and patient investor base."</p>
<p>This increased efficiency along with a higher production level makes the U.S. an excellent player in the worldwide oil market that can emerge to a better energy sector to handle both changes in domestic and international demands.</p>

<h2 id="natural-gas-exports-continue-to-grow"><strong>Natural Gas Exports Continue to Grow</strong></h2>
<p>This is when, with its becoming a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, the United States has more rather than less consolidated its grip in the energy market worldwide, with gross exports of natural gas at all-time highs at 4.7 quads in 2019 and with growth upped by 29% in 2018. Growth trends are highly influenced by relatively unstable prices for natural gas imports, making the U.S. industries prone to drawing on domestic sources rather than drawing from an international market, which is sometimes fairly unpredictable.</p>
<p>The average import price of natural gas to the US declined from $5.30 per thousand cubic feet in 2014 to $2.54 in 2019, and it was $2.24 in 2016. This is most especially true when it comes to pipeline imports coming from Canada and Mexico as these cut their prices from $5.21 thousand cubic feet in six years to $2.44 thousand cubic feet.</p>
<p>The export prices have also been relatively stable. They declined from $5.51 per thousand cubic feet to $3.64 over the 2014 to 2019 period. As such, many countries wanted to import American natural gas during that period. Imports to Mexico increased from 27.5 billion cubic feet in 2016 to 142.4 billion cubic feet in 2019. Imports to Japan increased from 11.1 billion cubic feet to 201.1 billion cubic feet during the same period.</p>
<p>This increased exportation of natural gas tells much about the United States's capability to both supply the country and meet international energy demands and its strategic position in the global market.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="slight-increase-in-net-coal-imports"><strong>Slight Increase in Net Coal Imports</strong></h2>
<p>Although the United States has remained a net exporter of coal since 1949, there does seem to be a visible trend of late in the export dynamics of coal from that region. Gross coal exports decreased by 19.7% between 2018 and 2019, thus showing an inability to sustain trading partnerships. Of course, such a phenomenon resonates with the larger trend toward self-sufficiency adopted by most nations, including the U.S. For instance, during the first eight months of 2018, Indian domestic coal production was growing at 9.8%. At the end of the year, according to Energy World, five power plants with "critical" and "supercritical" coal resources showed healthy reserves.</p>
<p>However, that is not just a trend in India. The international trend is that exports of US coal to Asia fell by 19.4 percent over the same period, and North America and Europe imported 24.1 percent less coal from the United States. Some cases are quite extreme; take the case of Panama which reduced imports of US coal by 99.5 percent within just one year.</p>
<p>Such changes indicate a deeper transition in the global energy picture rather than a response in specific individual nations to certain policies or circumstances that have resulted in this fall in US coal exports. In this respect, while countries are filling their own domestic needs with domestic supply, the problem for the US is holding onto the export volumes it had under a relatively inelastic past market.</p>
